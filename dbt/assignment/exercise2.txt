1. Select from any table a number and determine whether it is within a given range (for 
example, between 1 and 10).
--create table r(num int);
insert into r values(1),(2),(3),(4);
delimiter //
create procedure checknum(in num1 int,in num2 int)
 begin
declare fnum int;
select num into fnum   from r where num between num1 and num2 limit 1;
 if fnum is not null then
select concat(fnum,'is between', num1,'and',num2) as resultMsg
else 
 select concat (fnum,'is not between',num1,'and',num2)as resultMsg
end if;
end //
delimiter;
call checknum(3,4);
select * from r;
-----------------------------------------------------------
2. Select from any table three positive integers representing the sides of a triangle, and 
determine whether they form a valid triangle. Hint: In a triangle, the sum of any two 
sides must always be greater than the third side.
-create  table Tt(a int, b int,c int); 
delimiter//
 	create procedure triangle(IN n1 int,IN n2 int,IN  n3 int)
	begin 
		declare a  int;
		declare b int;
		declare c int;
 		set a = n1;
		set b = n2;
 		set c = n3;
 		if(a+b>c) AND (a+c>b) AND (b+c>a) then
			select 'it is a triangle' as resultmsg;
		else 
			 select 'it is not a traingle' as resultmsg;
		end if;
	end//
delimiter ;
call triangle(1,2,3);
//select * from Tt;
-------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Check if a given a year is a leap year. The condition is:- year should be (divisible by 4 
and not divisible by 100) or (divisible by 4 and divisible by 400.). The year should be 
Selected from some table.
-
 create table l( num int);
 delimiter //
 create procedure leapy( in y int)
begin
 if ( y%4=0 AND y% 100!=0) OR (y%400=0) then
 	select 'it is a leap year' as resultmsg;
 else 
	 select 'it is a not leap year' as resultmsg;
 end if ;
 end //
delimiter;
call leapy(2000);

Q4.4. Write a program that Selects from any table two character strings. Your program should 
then determine if one character string exists inside another character string.
