1. Write a stored procedure by the name of Comp_intr to calculate the amount of 
interest on a bank account that compounds interest yearly. The formula is:- I 
= p (1+ r) y
â€“ p 
where:- 
 I is the total interest earned. 
 p is the principal. 
 r is the rate of interest as a decimal less than 1, and 
 y is the number of years the money is earning interest.
--create table CI ( interest decimal(7,2),total_amount decimal(10,2));
delimiter //
 create procedure Comp_intr(in  p decimal(7,2), in r decimal(7,2), in y decimal(7,2))
 begin 
 declare interest decimal(7,2);
declare total_amount decimal(7,2);
set interest = p*(power((1+r),y)-1);
 set total_amount = p+interest;
insert into CI (interest , total_amount) values(interest,total_amount);
end //
 delimiter ;
 call Comp_intr(1000.0,0.12,3.0);
select * from CI;

Q2.Create a stored function by the name of Age_calc. Your stored function should 
accept the date of birth of a person as a parameter. The stored function should 
calculate the age of the person in years. The stored function should return the age 
in years
-
  create table y( age int);
 delimiter //
mysql> create function Age_calc(dob DATE)
    -> returns int
    -> Deterministic
    -> Begin
    -> declare age int;
    -> set age = YEAR(CURDATE())-YEAR(dob);
    -> if (MONTH(CURDATE())<MONTH(dob)) OR (MONTH(CURDATE())=MONTH(dob) AND DAY(CURDATE())<DAY(dob))THEN
    -> set age = age-1;
    -> end if;
    -> return age;
    -> end //
     delimiter ;
 insert into y(age) values(Age_calc('1997-07-06'));
select * from y;
